    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Chicken and dumplings is a soup that consists of a chicken cooked in water, with the resulting chicken broth
        being used to cook the dumplings by boiling.[1] A dumpling—in this context—is a biscuit dough, which is a
        mixture of flour, shortening, and liquid (water, milk, buttermilk,[2] or chicken stock). The dumplings are
        either rolled out flat, dropped,[1] or formed into a ball.</p>
    <p>It is a popular comfort food dish,[2][3] commonly found in the Southern[2][4] and Midwestern United States, that
        is also attributed to being a French Canadian meal that originated during the Great Depression. Some sources say
        that chicken and dumplings originated in the Southern United States during the antebellum era and was considered
        a mainstay during harsh economic times.[5] One of the earliest versions of the recipe was cornmeal dumplings
        cooked with turnip greens.[6] Chicken and dumplings as a dish is prepared with a combination of simmered chicken
        meat, broth produced by simmering the chicken, multiple dumplings, and salt and pepper for seasoning. Sometimes
        finely chopped vegetables, such as carrots and celery, are added to the broth, and herbs such as dill, parsley,
        thyme, or chives are added to the dumpling dough.[7]</p>

        <li>1 carton (32 oz) Progresso™ reduced-sodium chicken broth (4 cups)
