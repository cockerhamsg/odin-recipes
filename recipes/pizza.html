    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>What is pepperoni pizza made of?</p>
    <p>You need pizza crust, pizza sauce, cheese, and pepperoni. Pepperoni is basically an American version of salami.
        Pepperoni is a meat mixture of beef and pork that has been cured and seasoned with paprika and chili powder.
        It's a loved American food staple and most commonly used to make pepperoni pizza</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>16 ounces pizza dough, store-bought or homemade</li>
        <li>1/2 cup pizza sauce</li>
        <li>18 to 20 slices pepperoni</li>
        <li>12 ounces mozzarella cheese, grated</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon fresh oregano, optional</li>
        <li>Flour for rolling and shaping dough</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 500°F. If you are using a pizza stone, preheat it in the oven for at least 20 minutes so it
            is nice and hot as well.</li>
        <li>Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface. If it's hard to roll, let it rest for 5 minutes so it can come
            to room temperature. For a large pizza, I like to roll my dough into about a 14-inch diameter circle.</li>
        <li>
            <p>Transfer the dough to a lightly dusted pizza peel. Alternatively, fit it into a large cast-iron.</p>
            <p>Add sauce in a light layer all over the pizza, leaving about 1/4-inch crust around the edges. Chop half
                of the pepperoni and sprinkle it over the sauce. Top the pizza with grated cheese and the rest of the
                pepperoni. Season with black pepper.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>If you're using a pizza stone, carefully slide pizza into the center of the preheated pizza stone. Cook
                for 6 minutes, then rotate the pizza halfway so it cooks evenly. Cook for another 6-8 minutes, or until
                the crust is golden brown and charred in spots.</p>
            <p>If you're using a skillet, press the dough into a cast iron skillet and add toppings. Place the skillet
                over a high heat burner for 2 minutes to get it preheated and get the crust cooking right away. Then
                transfer to a 500 ̊F oven and bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Use pizza peel to slide pizza out onto a cutting board. Let the pizza rest for a minute and slice into
            pieces. Season with fresh oregano (optional)</li>
    </ol>
